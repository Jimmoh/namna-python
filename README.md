# namna-python
Namna deals in three types of products (X, Y and Z) and has several customers. Write a Python program to input for each purchase, customer name, type of product and the number of units of the product purchased.  Output should include salesperson name and the amount he or she should pay. Price per unit of Product X is sh. 80, and that of Y is sh. 95 while that of Z is sh. 135.  A buyer will buy only one of the three types of the products. For a total purchase value of over sh. 10000, a customer gets discount of 10% of purchase value of Product X. Purchases of Products Y or Z attract discount of 5% of purchase value. Purchases of Product X attract VAT of 16% of the net purchase value (i.e. purchase value after discount if any). There is no VAT for Product Y or Z. VAT is added to the amount to be paid by the customer.  The program should use a function in determining discount.
